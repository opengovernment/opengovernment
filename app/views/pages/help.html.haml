- title("Help Us Open Government")

%p We're a tiny non-profit project, free & open-source. We have a good start, but we need more resources to roll out OpenGovernment to all 50 U.S. states and beyond.

PPF Boosters donate one dollar per day, that's $10 per month, to support OpenGovernment. <a href="https://crm.aws.ppolitics.org/sites/all/modules/civicrm/bin/OneClick.php?oc_action=donate&pp=paypal&amount=10&recur=2&groups=PPF+News:PPF+Booster&receipt=45" target="_blank">Sign up on PayPal</a> -- smooth and hassle-free. 

%p <strong>Foundations</strong>: We seek funding partners to roll out OpenGovernmentÂ to all 50 U.S. states, cities, localities, and other countries. Download & circulate our <a href="#{ image_path 'OpenGovernment_prospectus_March_2011.pdf' }">non-profit funding prospectus</a> (in .pdf) for more information. <a href="/pages/contact">Get in touch</a> to start a conversation about how OpenGovernment can support your current program areas.
